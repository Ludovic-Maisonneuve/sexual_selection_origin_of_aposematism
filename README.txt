Programs for the Preprint Article: "The Sexual Selection Hypothesis for the Origin of Aposematism"
Authors: Ludovic Maisonneuve, Thomas Aubier
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.26.615118

This repository contains scripts related to the preprint article by Maisonneuve and Aubier, with contributions from Arthur Weyna. The scripts generate figures and tables found in the article.

Contents:

1. fig_1_to_4: Contains the necessary notebooks to generate Figures 1 through 4 as presented in the preprint.
- NoteBookToMakeFig1to4.nb: A Mathematica notebook that produces Figures 1â€“4 of the preprint.
- numerical_functions.nb: Written by Arthur Weyna, this notebook contains functions that apply selection gradients iteratively to traits, enabling to simulate evolutionary dynamics. It is called by NoteBookToMakeFig1to4.nb.

2. fig_5_and_tab_1_&_2: Python Scripts for Figure 1 and Tables
- launch_sensitivity_analysis_Model_X.py: Executes sensitivity analyses using Model X (where X=1 represents a model with sex-independent traits, and X=2 represents a model with sex-dependent traits). These analyses can be run multiple times in parallel by renaming the output files to store the data sequentially.
- convert_data_to_CSV_Model_X.py: Converts the data generated by launch_sensitivity_analysis_Model_X.py into CSV format.
- figure_5.py: Generates Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c from the preprint.
- Table_X.py: Produces Table X from the preprint.
- functions.py: A helper file for launch_sensitivity_analysis_Model_X.py, containing functions to simulate evolutionary dynamics and save the results.
